I don't have anything I really wanna put here, so here are some quotes I like:

"You will never come up against a greater adversary than your own potential, my young friend."
 ― Dr. Paul Stubbs (Ken Jenkins) to Wesley Crusher (TNG 3x01)

"No man chooses evil because it is evil; he just mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks.”
 ― Mary Wollstonecraft"
 
"Previously I thought through songs and poems and drawings I could find and build a refuge away from his world, but there is the matter of Justice. And I'll tell you it's not just a metaphor. The desire for it actually burns. It hurts. There needs to be something more."
― David Berman
